Notes for Noelle (3/28):
Dataset from Zillow (ZORI) is settled. 2,263 rows, each representing a different zip code in the 100 largest US markets.

Plan to create a predictive model based on 2014-18 data (for 2019, then compare predicted results vs. actual) and 2014-19 data (for 2020) so that we can see what a ML model would 
have predicted had there been no COVID in 2020, affecting rental markets.
Items to-do:
1) Data cleansing is still in process, to impute missing values (every monthly column has some data missing, perhaps markets or zip codes that didn't report).
2) Change zip codes to strings, then move them to the index value.
3) Create a cluster model for every year, starting in 2014 and ending in 2020.
4) Start visualizations.  Possible segments for dividing: geographic by regions, by state, by similar rental rates.
